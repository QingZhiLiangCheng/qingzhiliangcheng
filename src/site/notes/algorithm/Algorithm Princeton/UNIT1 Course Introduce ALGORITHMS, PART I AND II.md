- algorithm: method for solving a problem
- data structure: store the information associated in problem, with a problem go haind in hand with algorithm 

why we should one study algorithms?
- the main reason the people study algorithm, is to be able to solve problems that it could not otherwise be addressed.
	for example, a network connection  problem, find a way from one to another, so we need a computer  program to do it, we need an efficient algorithm to do it.
- another resaon is to for intellectural stimulation.
- to become a proficient programmer.
	Algorithm+Data structure=Programs ------- Niklans Wirth
- they may unlock the secrets of life and the universe
	computational models are replacing math models in scientific inquiry.
- have a better chance at interviewing for a job
