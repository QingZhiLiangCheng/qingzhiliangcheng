### Chapter 1 Review Questions
**Sectrion 1.1**
**R1.** What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?
其实书中给出，其实我们一般认为host = end system. 但其实书中也给出了host和end system有不同的地方。end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet；host：hosts because they host (that is, run) application。
different types of end systems: 书中原话是这么说的: The Internet's end systems include desktop computers(e.g., destio PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers(e.g., Web and e-mail servers), and mobile devices(e.g., laptops, smartphones, and tablets).

**R2.** The word protocol is often used to describe diplomatic relations. How does Wikipedia describe diplomatic protocol?
这道题是关于diplomatic protocol(外交协议)的，没啥意思
这里可以给网络术语中的protocol的定义: 协议是对等层实体在通信过程中所遵守的规则的集合，包括语法，语义和时序

**R3**. Why are standards important for protocols?
原书中是这么说的：Given the importance of protocols to the Internet, it's important that everyone agree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and products that interoperate.
其实就是更好的工作和合作，包括不同企业生产的不同的设备通过一起工作等等，包括更好的更安全的传输数据

**Section 1.2**
**R4.** List four access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise access, or wide-area wireless access.

**R5.** Is HFC transmission rate dedicated or shared among users? Are collisions possible in a downstream HFC channel? Why or why not?

**R6.** List the available residential access technologies in your city. For each type of access, provide the advertised downstream rate, upstream rate, and monthly price.

**R7.** What is the transmission rate of Ethernet LANs?

**R8.** What are some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over?

**R9.** HFC, DSL, and FTTH are all used for residential access. For each of these access technologies, provide a range of transmission rates and comment on whether the transmission rate is shared or dedicated.

**R10.** Describe the most popular wireless Internet access technologies today. Compare and contrast them.
